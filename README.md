In this project, we have implemented the data link layer protocols, with Stop and Wait ARQ. This is based on the stop-and-wait flow control technique. It is a method used in telecommunications to send information between two connected devices. A stop-and-wait ARQ sender sends one frame at a time. After sending each frame, the sender doesn't send any further frames until it receives an acknowledgment (ACK) signal. The receiver uses the redundancy check number to check for possible damage. If the receiver sees that the frame is good, it sends an ACK.
